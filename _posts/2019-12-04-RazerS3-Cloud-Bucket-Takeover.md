## Summary
There was potential for some Razer product collateral to be leaked, so Razer secured this bucket out of caution.

## Proof ofÂ Concept
### Google Dorks
[Google Dorking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking), also known as Google Hacking, was used to reveal insecure permissions on the S3 bucket.

I used the following payload:

{% highlight markdown %}
site:s3.amazonaws.com <target>

{% endhighlight %}

S3 bucket URL: https://razer-assets2.s3.amazonaws.com

Bucket name found, **razer-assets2**

### Listing content
Let's see the content using `ls` command.

{% highlight markdown %}
~ > aws s3 ls s3://razer-assets2
